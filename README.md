# Energy-Usage-Prediction
# Introduction
In this project, the challenge presented by the "ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III" competition is being tackled. The
project focus is on developing a tool to evaluate the value of energy efficiency upgrades in energy savings. This involves
constructing counterfactual models to compare post-upgrade energy consumption against modelled values for the original
building, thereby estimating retrofit savings.
The dataset provided for this project encompasses building metadata, weather data, and energy consumption records. The
main challenge is to develop predictive models capable of forecasting energy usage for multiple buildings.
